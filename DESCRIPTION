Description: The initial version (0.1.2) contains a collection of easy-to-implement tools for checking whether a MAIC can be conducted. An alternative way of calculating weights is also included. These methods are introduced in Glimm & Yau (2021) <doi:10.1002/pst.2210>. The second version (0.2.0) adds an exact matching as an alternative to propensity score matching method.
