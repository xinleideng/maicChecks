Description: The second version (0.2.0) contains implementation for exact matching which is an alternative to propensity score matching (see Glimm & Yau (2025)). The initial version (0.1.2) contains a collection of easy-to-implement tools for checking whether a MAIC can be conducted, as well as an alternative way of calculating weights (see Glimm & Yau (2021) <doi:10.1002/pst.2210>.)
